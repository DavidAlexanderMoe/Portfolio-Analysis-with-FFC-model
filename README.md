# Portfolio Analysis with Fama & French & Carhart model

The aim of this report is to analyze a set of ten portfolios composed by unknown UK stocks applying the Fama&French&Carhart 4 factor model to them with the purpose of studying the analogies and the differences. We have been provided with monthly data from October 1980 to December 2010 containing:
  1. The returns of the ten UK portfolios. Stocks have been assigned to portfolios based on their market capitalization, from the smallest to the largest;
  2. The four risk factors of the Fama&French&Carhart model (SMB, HML, UMD and RMRF);
  3. The risk-free return.
